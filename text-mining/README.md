# text-mining
A simple tool for text-mining tweets using the official Twitter Streaming API and written in Python for Big Data analysis. Read more about the API [here](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.6
- [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
- [PyMongo 3.0.3+](https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/)
- [mongoDB 3.0.5](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- Your very own Twitter app - register one [here](https://apps.twitter.com)

_Note: please follow the installation instruction found on the official Tweepy repo before continuing. Also make sure you have all the required software installed and set up before proceeding._

## Installation
- ``` git clone https://github.com/anthonymonori/text-mining.git ./text-mining ```
- ``` cd ./text-mining ```
- ``` sudo pip install requirements.txt ```
- ``` open _conf.ini ```
- ``` mv _conf.ini conf.ini ```

## Usage
``` python text-mining.py hashtag1 hashtag2 ... ```

_Note: Currently saves the tweets into a collection called tweets in a mongodb database called test._

## Use cases
- Data mining of tweets for Big Data analysis
- Dumping data into a database a.k.a. collecting
- Parse the stream into a live-feed of tweets
- Any other ideas? Let me know

## Todo
- [x] Add mongoDB integration using PyMongo driver
- [ ] Add database settings into the global conf file
- [ ] Change database and collection naming
- [ ] Put the project on Travis CI
- [ ] Better wrapper; possibly extend it to a command-line tool
